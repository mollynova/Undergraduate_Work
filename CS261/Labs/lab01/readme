-- Lab01 Readme

If you've made it this far, congratulations!!!

For the rest of this lab we are going to compile a couple of programs and run
them.  In future lessons we will learn how to edit files and debug programs.
We're just starting off simple today.

-- hello

It is typical that your first program in a new environment is the "hello
world" program.  This is a simple program that just prints a string.  You do
this basically to make sure that you know how to get something simple and
basic working.  From the command line type:

/usr/jdk/bin/javac Hello.java

If you've done everything correctly up till now then this will run without any
errors (i.e., it won't produce any ouptut to the screen).  If you do a
directory listing you will see a new file called "Hello.class". Now, you can
run this program by typing the following command:

/usr/jdk/bin/java Hello

If you do this successfully you will see the phrase "Hello, world!" printed to
the screen.

That's all with hello.

-- secret code

The final part of this lab is to compile the program found in the file
Lab01.java.  I'm not going to give you the command to create this.  I'm going
to let you figure it out by examining what you did with the Hello.java file
(see above).  Once you successfully compile the main program.  Run it.  It
should generate output similar to this:

Username: mike.noel
Class ID: 11585692

Everyone will have a different ID (and I know what your ID should be).

-- Lab completion

To show that you have completed the lab you need to send me email with your
ID.  Once I receive this then I will mark you down as having sucessfully
completed the lab.
