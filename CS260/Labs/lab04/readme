-- Lab04 Readme

For this lab we are going to get more practice writing and compiling programs
on linux. The purpose is to gain experience using a text editor and the
compiler.  It is assumed that you have already done all previous lab
exercises.

-- Setup

Use the instructions in the previous lessions to create a new directory called
"lab04" in your "labs" directory.  After you have created the directory make
sure that you "go into" the "lab04" directory (Hint: "go into x" means "change
your current directory to x").

-- Creating a bar chart

Your program for this lab exercise will create a vertical bar chart of some
number of integer values.  The program will ask the user how many values they
will enter (between 1 and 20, inclusive) and then will prompt the user to
enter each value (between 0 and 10, inclusive).  After all of the data is
entered then the program will create a vertical bar chart using "*"
characters.

This is an example run of how your program should work
----------------------------------------------------------------------

How many values will you enter: 8

Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):1
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):2
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):4
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):0
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):10
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):7
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):-1
Invalid value.  Try again.
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):8
Enter a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive):3

Feel free to use as many classes as you want with this program.  Think about
object oriented design and what sorts of classes you would want.  There are
multiple ways to design this but one possibility is that you have a class
DataSet that contains the data and another class BarCharter that is a class
that knows how to print a vertical bar chart given a DataSet.

-- Lab completion

To show that you have completed the lab you need to turn in the assignment
using the "turnin" program.  The command to turn in your file is
"~mike.noel/bin/turnin cs260 filename".  Replace "filename" with the actual
name of your file.  This command only generates output if there is an error.
