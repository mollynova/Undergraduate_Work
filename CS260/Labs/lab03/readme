-- Lab03 Readme

For this lab we are going to get more practice writing and compiling programs
on linux. The purpose is to gain experience using a text editor and the
compiler.  It is assumed that you have already done all previous lab
exercises.

-- Setup

Use the instructions in the previous lessions to create a new directory called
"lab03" in your "labs" directory.  After you have created the directory make
sure that you "go into" the "lab03" directory (Hint: "go into x" means "change
your current directory to x").

-- Write a program

After you have setup your lab directory it's time to write a program.  You
will write a program that simulates an investment account balance over the
course of a few years.  This investment account has a fixed annual return rate
and the interest is compounding yearly.  That means that you add the amount
gained due to interest each year to the existing balance.

Your program will start by reading in the starting balance, interest rate, and
number of years.  They it will print a table showing the balance each
year. All inputs should be integers.

Here is an example run of the program:

Enter starting balance: 5000
Enter interest rate: 5
Enter number of years: 10

Year 1 $5250.0
Year 2 $5512.5
Year 3 $5788.125
Year 4 $6077.53125
Year 5 $6381.4078125
Year 6 $6700.478203125
Year 7 $7035.50211328125
Year 8 $7387.277218945313
Year 9 $7756.641079892578
Year 10 $8144.473133887207

Your program should generate the same output (in the same format) as this example.

-- Lab completion

To show that you have completed the lab you need to turn in the assignment
using the "turnin" program.  The command to turn in your file is
"~mike.noel/bin/turnin cs260 filename".  Replace "filename" with the actual
name of your file.  This command only generates output if there is an error.
