-- Lab01 Readme

If you've made it this far, congratulations!!!

For the rest of this lab we are going to compile a couple of programs and run
them.  In future lessons we will learn how to edit files and debug programs.
We're just starting off simple today.

-- hello

It is typical that your first program in a new environment is the "hello
world" program.  This is a simple program that just prints a string.  You do
this basically to make sure that you know how to get something simple and
basic working.  From the command line type:

g++ -o hello hello.cpp

If you've done everything correctly up till now then this will run without any
errors (i.e., it won't produce any ouptut to the screen).  If you do a
directory listing you will see a new file called "hello" -- note that there
isn't an extension.  Linux doesn't use file extensions to decide if something
is a program or not.  Now, you can run this program by typing the following
command:

./hello

Note the "./" at the beginning of the command.  This is critical.  If you
don't have "./" then you will get an error.  If you do this successfully you
will see the word "hello" printed to the screen.

That's all with hello.

-- secret code

The final part of this lab is to compile the program found in the file
main.cpp.  I'm not going to give you the command to create this.  I'm going to
let you figure it out be examining what you did with the hello.cpp file (see
above).  Once you successfully compile the main.cpp program.  Run it.  It
should generate output similar to this:

Username: mike.noel
Class ID: 11585692

Everyone will have a different ID (and I know what your ID should be).

-- Lab completion

To show that you have completed the lab you need to send me email with your
ID.  Once I receive this then I will mark you down as having sucessfully
completed the lab.
