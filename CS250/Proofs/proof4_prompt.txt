This week, you'll be translating some English statements into quantified logical statements and proving one.

First, write exercises 4.1.57-59 in your textbook as quantified logical statements, using the universal and existential quantifiers, and defining predicates as needed. 
Second, write the negations of each of these statements in the same way. 
Finally, choose one of these statements to prove. If it is true, prove it, and if it is false, prove its negation. Your proof need not use symbols, but can be a simple explanation in plain English. 

You may find that reading section 4.1 is helpful, but I think that this can be done without doing so. Good luck!
