This week, please prove a nifty divisibility trick from grade school:

If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, 
then than number is divisible by 3.

Prior to your proof, please write the statement in a formal mathematical style.
In your proof, please justify each step as we've been doing in class and HW.
If you need some context to figure out how to prove this, please reference the
final exercises in section 4.3 of your book. 
Good luck!!!
